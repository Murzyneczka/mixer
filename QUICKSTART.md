# Quick Start Guide

## What's Been Fixed

âœ… **Tone.js Package Added**
- Added Tone.js v14.7.77 as a local npm package
- Updated HTML to load Tone.js from `node_modules` instead of CDN
- This allows the app to run completely offline

âœ… **Audio Upload Fixed**
- Enhanced error handling for audio file uploads
- Added file validation (type and size checks)
- Maximum file size: 50MB per file
- Better feedback with loading indicators and toast notifications
- Automatic cleanup of object URLs to prevent memory leaks

âœ… **UI Loading Issues Resolved**
- Fixed all JavaScript modules to use `window.` global scope
- All components (AudioEngine, UI, Transport, etc.) are now properly accessible
- Proper initialization order ensures everything loads correctly

## How to Run

1. **Install dependencies** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the local server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Open your browser** and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Testing the Fixes

### Test Audio Upload:

1. Open the application
2. Click "Tap to add audio" in the sidebar
3. Select one or more audio files (MP3, WAV, etc.)
4. You should see:
   - Loading spinner while files are processing
   - Success message for each loaded file
   - Files appear in the track list
   - Waveform displays in the main area

### Test UI Loading:

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Check that there are no errors about "undefined" objects
4. Try clicking different tabs: Waveform, Timeline, Effects, Tracks
5. All features should work without console errors

### Test Tone.js Integration:

1. Load an audio file
2. Click Play button
3. Audio should play smoothly
4. Try adjusting effects (Reverb, Delay, EQ)
5. Effects should be applied in real-time

## Common Audio File Formats Supported

- MP3 (.mp3)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Clear browser cache** and reload
2. **Check console** for error messages (F12 â†’ Console)
3. **Verify Tone.js** is loaded: Type `Tone` in console, should return an object
4. **Check file permissions** if audio files won't load
5. **Try smaller files** first (under 10MB)

## Next Steps
